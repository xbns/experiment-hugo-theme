```
Always be drunk.That's it!
The great imperative!
In order not to feel Time's horrid fardel bruise your shoulders,grinding you into the earth,
Get drunk and stay that way.
On what?
On wine,poetry,virtue,whatever.

But get drunk
And if you sometimes happen to wake up,on the porches
of a palace,in the green grass of a ditch,in the dismal loneliness of your own room,

You drunkeness gone or disappearing,ask the wind, the wave,the star, the bird, the clock.
Ask everything that flees,everything that groans or rolls or sings,everything that speaks.
Ask what time it is; and the wind, the wave,the star,the bird,the clock will answer you;
"Time to get drunk!"


Don't be martyred slaves of time,
Get Drunk!
Stay Drunk!
On wine,virtue,poerty,whatever!

Charles Baudelaire(France)
